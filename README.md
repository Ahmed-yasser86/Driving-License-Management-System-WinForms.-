## ⚠️ Learning Project Disclaimer  

This project was developed as part of my learning journey in **C# and .NET development**. While it implements core functionalities, some advanced concepts were **not fully applied** at the time, such as:  

- **Loggings** for better debugging and monitoring.  
- **Windows Registry** for system-level configurations.  
- **Advanced C# topics**, ..etc  
- **T-SQL (Transact-SQL)** for advanced database operations.  

This means some areas may **not follow best practices** or could be improved. Future enhancements and refactoring will address these gaps. 🚀
